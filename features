Implemented Functions :

1. add-body (adds a body to the world)
2. remove-body (removes a body of given id from the world)
3. alert (invokes alert)
4. remove-clicked (removes the last clicked body) 						<=> (remove-body id-mouse-up) 
5. click-coords (a list of coordinates of the last mouse up on canvas)		<=> (list x-up y-up)
6. alert-coords (alerts last clicked coordinates) 						<=> (alert (click-coords))

7. on (adds an event handler)
		when the 1st argument happens, code enclosed in 2nd argument is evaluated 
		(adds the event handler to the event)
		Supported handlers :
			-> mouseup (e.g : (on mouseup "(remove id-mouse-up)")
			-> mousedown (e.g : (on mousedown "(remove id-mouse-down)")
			-> keydown (e.g : (on keydown "(if (= key-down 65) (apply-impulse "id3" (vector2 50.0 50.0)))")
			-> keyup (e.g : (on keyup "(if (= key-up 65) (apply-impulse "id3" (vector2 50.0 50.0)))")
			
8. ~on (removes event handler(s) , undoes 'on')

9. handler-data (returns a list of all handlers of event(s))

10. bg-color (changes the background color)
11. body-color (changes a body's color)
12. random (returns a random number)

13. apply-impulse (apply impulse and change the momentum of a body)
	e.g : (apply-impulse "id3" (vector2 10.0 150.0))
14. apply-force (apply force for a required period of time on a body)
	e.g : (apply-force "id3" (vector2 1000.0 150.0) 5000) -> applies force for 5000 ms

Implemented Variables :

1. x-up & y-up (coordinates of the last mouse up on canvas)
2. x-down & y-down (coordinates of the last mouse down on canvas)
3. body-count (number of bodies in the world)
4. body-list (list of ids of all bodies in defined in the world)
5. canvas-width & canvas-height (dimensions of the HTML5 canvas in pixels)
6. id-mouse-up (id of the last mouse up body)
7. id-mouse-down (id of the last mouse down body)
8. key-down (code of the last pressed key)
9. key-up (code of released key)
